          KarZen, Inc. (“we”, “us”, or “our”) has created this
          privacy policy (“Policy”) to inform you (“you” or “your”)
          of when and how information is collected, used, disclosed
          and protected through our services (“Service”) and
          website located at karzen.io. By using the Service, you
          consent to the privacy practices described in this
          Policy.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          We may change this Policy from time to time. Continued
          use of the Service after any such changes shall
          constitute your consent to such changes. If we make any
          changes to this Policy, we will change the “last updated”
          date above.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or
          other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you
          have the authority to bind that company or other legal
          entity to this Policy, in such event, “You” will refer
          and apply to that company or other legal entity.

        <h4>INFORMATION GATHERING</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
          <li>We collect, use and disclose two types of information: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.</li>
          <li>“Personal Information” is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a user’s name, email address, username and password. When you choose to pay for the Service after your trial is over, our payment processing vendor collects your payment information and billing address.</li>
          <li>“Non-Personal Information” is information we collect that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</li>
          <li>We may group “Non-Personal Information” into “Aggregate Data” to help us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of Non-Personal and Aggregate Data, and we may share Non-Personal and Aggregate Data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customer needs and improve our Service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.</li>
          <li>We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Service. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring web site addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files or pages accessed or used by you.</li>
          <li>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. We use cookies to enable you to use the Service without re-entering your username and password if you select to use the “Remember Me” functionality. A “web beacon” is an electronic image that is embedded in a web page. We use “web beacons” to count visits and compile statistics on usage or in our emails to tell if an email has been opened or acted upon.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <p>
          We use collected information about you to process your
          requests or billing transactions, to provide you with
          information or services you request, to inform you about
          other information, events, promotions, products, or
          services we think will be of interest to you, and to
          support and facilitate your usage of the Service.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h4>
        <p>
          We will not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any of your
          Personal Information or any data that you store using our
          Service to any third party except i) with your explicit
          consent or ii) as outlined in this Policy. We reserve the
          right to share Non-Personal and Aggregate Data about our
          customers, sales, and traffic to our partners and
          advertisers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose Personal Information to a third party to
          (a) comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and
          legal process, (b) to protect us, our customers and
          others, including to enforce our agreements, policies and
          terms of use, or (c) in the good faith belief that such
          disclosure is needed to respond to an emergency, or
          protect the personal safety of any person.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share Personal Information in connection with an
          acquisition, merger, or sale of all or a substantial
          portion of our business, with or to another company. In
          any such event, you will receive notice if your data is
          transferred and becomes subject to a substantially
          different privacy policy.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>MODIFYING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <p>
          If you are a registered user of our Service, you may
          review, update, correct or delete your personal
          information simply by logging into the Service and
          editing your profile.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>SECURITY</h4>
        <p>
          We are very concerned with safeguarding your information.
          We take reasonable steps to protect information we
          collect from you to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized
          access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Highly
          confidential personal information such as credit card
          data is protected with encryption using Secured Socket
          Layer (SSL) technology during transmission over the
          Internet. But remember that no method of transmission
          over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
          secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your account information and access to our Service is
          accessible only through the use of an individual username
          and password. You should keep your password confidential
          and do not disclose it to any other person. Please note
          that we will never ask you to disclose your password in
          an unsolicited phone call or email.
        </p>

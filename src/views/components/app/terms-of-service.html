            <h4>NOTICES</h4>
            <p>
              If any part of these Terms of Service are determined to
              be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law
              including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers
              and liability limitations set forth above, then the
              invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
              superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most
              closely matches the intent of the original provision, and
              the remainder of this agreement shall continue in effect.
              A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any
              notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in

              operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
              consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any
              attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of
              Service, without such consent, will be null and of no
              effect. We may assign or transfer these Terms of Service,

              obligations under these Terms of Service, except for
              payment obligations, where and to the extent that such a

              of such party. Such causes shall include, without
              limitation, delays caused by the other party, failures
              caused by a third-party service, acts of God or of the
